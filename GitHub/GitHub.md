#### The need for GitHub
GitHub is a platform for hosting and maintaining your code online. It makes collaboration easier with version control and markdown. Version control system is a system which allows multiple people to work on the same project without interference. It also lets you track the changes made by different people. Google drive also employs a version control. You might have noticed that google keeps track of who makes the edits in the shared folder. Changes made can also be rolled back. GitHub is a made into a powerful tool when you combine it with git command line.
